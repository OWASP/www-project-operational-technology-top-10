# OT for IT Sec People

This introduction tries to explain for IT security people why OT security looks
the way it often looks.

!!! Info "Work in Progress"

    It should link most of the final top 10 items, as they should be related..
    and should provide an IT-centric storyline how all of those Top 10 items
    'play together'

## The OT World

All professional communities have their own work culture and mindset, and people
only working in IT security may not even be aware of the cultural "waters" in
which they "swim". OT is a separate culture and things work rather differently.

When IT security people look at OT scenarios, some miscomprehensions often
occur, sometimes leading to suggestions like "why don't you just update
components?", "why don't you replace these insecure protocols?" or,
"just buy new hardware".

Sadly, the situation and requirements within the OT world are a bit different
to typical IT requirements. Understanding those differences helps to
understand how some of our OT Top 10 came to be. Some of the conceptional
issues in the OT world are:

- **Long lifetime of products**: decades rather than years. Remember computer
  security thirty years ago? This is our current security level in some OT setups.

- **Hard to Update**: it's rather hard to update a powerplant. To do this you might
  need a spare power-plant to bridge the loss of power generated by the currently
  being-updated power plant. In other domains, e.g., life-sustaining medical devices, the
  update might not even be possible without endangering users.

- **Lack of Integrity-Protection or encrypted Protocols**: due to the long lifetimes,
  many OT protocols neither support encryption nor integrity protection. Within some
  scenarios, e.g., on a manufactoring floor, encryption is actually not a wanted feature
  as it makes network monitoring more complex.

These are realities within the field with which we have to deal. Very often,
we do not work in greenfield projects but have to adapt existing systems while
improving security. In addition, we have security problems such as vendors not
providing security updates or devices lacking proper access control semantics.

When you look into recent news, OT security incidents are on the rise. While it
would be preferable to have a perfect secure solution, sadly we're currently
only catching up and thus any (substantial) security improvement is welcome.

## Devices must be protected

As shown before, in the OT world we often have to deal with potentially
inherently insecure devices that might not be updated or upgraded too.

Typically this issue is mitigated by accepting some devices to be insecure
and preventing attackers from accessing them in the first place: if we
cannot make the devices themselves secure, we try to prevent attackers
from accessing them in the first place.

### We depend upon Mitigations

This is typically done through mitigations such as network separation or
through adding physical security controls. Begin able to 'lock away'
devices and their network also helps with devices that can only use
network protocols without integrity or confidenciality protections.

These remediations are not a "get out of jail free" card and impose
limitations as well as maintenance burden.

Please note that we would prefer to have secure devices (or even
zero-trust enabled devices) but until then, often those mitigations
are the only way of keeping critical infrastructure operational.

As risk is typically calculated by "Risk = Likelyhood x Impact" and this
would reduce the Likelyhood to zero, we can close the case, right? Sadly, NO.

## What happens if Mitigations fail?

What could go wrong with our mitigations? Just a couple of examples:

!!! info "add incidents from the top 10 list"

- human error
- stuxnet/USB disks
- missing network segmentation between factory floor and office networks
- problems with physical security, people being able to get on the
  factory floor and manipulating control systems
- etc.

The overall architecture of "protecting insecure devices by preventing
attackers from accessing them" breaks down if attackers find a way to
bypass these protections.

If this happens, we typically run into reoccuring major problems:

- The insecure devices are, well, insecure and easy to exploit.
  Communication between devices can be intercepted and altered due to
  lack of encryption or integrity protection

- Large blast zones: attackers that are able to bypass security
  mechanisms and are able to compromise devices, can use those devices
  to further propagate and privot into other 'secured' networks and devices.

### How do we react to an incident?

Compared to well-maintained traditional IT systems, OT systems often
also display a lack of recoverability. Very often, compromised companies
are not able to react to or recover from incidents.

!!! info "add concrete examples of not being able to recover, also why can't we just reboot everything from scratch?"

This is mostly due to:

- missing backups/disaster recovery
- Missing configuration backups for OT-Devices
- Undefined processes for alert reporting/handling

## Fields of Compromise

We hope that this introduction explains why we often have to compromise to get
some security done. In legacy settings, this mostly means depending upon mitigations
such as network seggretation or physical access management. Hopefully, newer systems
will alleviate these problems, but we still have to deal with legacy systems to
keep existing critical infrastructure running.

Compromise has another meaning too: often we over-rely on mitigations and if those
are not uphold, our systems become compromised. If there are not additional
defense-in-depth measures in place, the potential fallout is immense as further
compromise-able systems are often within the blast radius. This makes additional
hardening even more important than within traditional IT systems.

Getting critical infrastructure secure will be quite a journey. But that is no excuse
for not starting this journey right now.
