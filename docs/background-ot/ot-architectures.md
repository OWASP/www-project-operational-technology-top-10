# OT Architecture

Idea: give an example of how OT architecture looks like, this might help people understand some of the typical problems

## Typical Components within an OT architecture

(either here or within `Introduction to OT`, whereever it is best suited)

## Purdue Model

## OT Case-Studies

- maybe use an example out of [NIST SP 800-82r3](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-82r3.ipd.pdf)
