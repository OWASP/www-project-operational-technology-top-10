# About OWASP

The [Open Worldwide Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/) ([OWASP](https://owasp.org/)) is an open community
dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain
applications and APIs that can be trusted.

At OWASP, you'll find free and open:

- Application security tools and standards
- Cutting edge research
- Standard security controls and libraries
- Complete books on application security testing, secure code development, and secure code review
- Presentations and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/OWASPGLOBAL)
- [Cheat sheets on many common topics](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/)
- [Chapters meetings](https://owasp.org/chapters/)
- [Events, training, and conferences](https://owasp.org/events/)

All OWASP tools, documents, videos, presentations, and chapters are free and
open to anyone interested in improving application security.

We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and
technology problem, because the most effective approaches to application
security require improvements in these areas.

OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from commercial pressures
allows us to provide unbiased, practical, and cost-effective information about
application security.

OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, although we support the
informed use of commercial security technology. OWASP produces many types of
materials in a collaborative, transparent, and open way.

The OWASP Foundation is the non-profit entity that ensures the project's
long-term success. Almost everyone associated with OWASP is a volunteer,
including the OWASP board, chapter leaders, project leaders, and project
members. We support innovative security research with grants and infrastructure.
