Idea: give an example of how OT architecture looks like, this might help people understand some of the typical problems

## Typical Components within an OT architecture

(either here or within `Introduction to OT`, whereever it is best suited)

## Purdue Model

- maybe use an example out of https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-82r3.ipd.pdf
