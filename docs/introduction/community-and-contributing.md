# Community and Contributing

This section should both show-off the hard work that our contributors are doing, as well as how to contribute to the project.

We're using the following communication channels:

- join the [OWASP OT Top 10 Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C07HDTYRA6R) to chat
- our [Github Repository](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-operational-technology-top-10) for adding issues or (preferably) adding changes through merge-requests.

Until the Top 10 have stabilized, we aim to do a video conference every two weeks. The next one will be announced on slack (and pinned there).

If you have one, please add them as new markdown file in the [docs/potential-top-10](/docs/potential-top-10) directory and link it from within [index.md](/index.md)'s list of potential top 10.
