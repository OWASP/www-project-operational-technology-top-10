## OWASP IoT Top 10

In OT we often analyze whole factory floors or power plants, situating our list of Top 10 vulnerabilities on a higher conceptional level. In addition, OT is burdened with long lifetimes and problematic update cycles placing a greater importance on defense-in-depth measures like good network segregation.

(I)IoT is a part of OT, but OT is broader in scope and utilized IoT devices within. This difference in scope is reflected in the Top Vulnerability list: when using the IoT Top 10, only 2 out of the 10 top vulnerabilities directly map onto the OT domain (I4 and I5).
