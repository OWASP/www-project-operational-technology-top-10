# What's next and where to start?

- give some concrete hints what would be good intial steps for different roles

## As a Builder

## As an Operator

## As a Security Professional

## For this project

- convert all current items from bullet-point lists to text-form
- fix the list behavior (e.g., 4 spaces are needed for new sublist items)
- move 'existing lists/top-11 items' to 'related OWASP projects' (and rename this into 'related projects')

### Template-specific

- rename the 'design/implementation' and 'operational' sections to something more role-specific?

### Conceptional problems

- high- vs low-level vulnerabilities? Maybe split out into a separate list (alternative: separate list for vendors/integrators and operators)
