- FAT
A Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) is a quality assurance process conducted at the manufacturer's site to verify that equipment or systems meet the required specifications before delivery.
- Hardening
(System) hardening is the process of securing a system by reducing its attack surface.
- HMI
A Human-Machine Interface (HMI) is a user interface that allows humans to interact with machines, systems, or devices.
- HVAC
HVAC stands for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning—a system used to regulate indoor climate and air quality.
- IDS
An IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is a cybersecurity tool that monitors network or system activity for signs of malicious behavior or policy violations.
- IEC
IEC stands for the International Electrotechnical Commission, a global organization that develops and publishes international standards for electrical, electronic, and related technologies.

- SCADA
SCADA stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, a system used to monitor and control industrial processes remotely.
- Segmentation
Network segmentation is the practice of dividing a computer network into smaller, isolated segments or subnets. This improves security, performance, and manageability by controlling traffic flow and limiting access between segments.
- SIS
Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) are automated systems designed to prevent hazardous events in industrial processes by taking a process to a safe state when predetermined conditions are violated.
- STIG
A Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) is a set of cybersecurity configuration standards developed by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). STIGs are used primarily by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and affiliated organizations to secure IT systems, software, and networks against cyber threats.
- Supply chain
A supply chain is the network of people, organizations, resources, activities, and technologies involved in the creation and delivery of a product or service from the supplier to the customer.
- Vulnerabilities
A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system, software, or network that can be exploited by a threat actor to gain unauthorized access, cause damage, or disrupt operations.
