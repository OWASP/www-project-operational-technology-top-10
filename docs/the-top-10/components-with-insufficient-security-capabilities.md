# Selection of components/protocols with insufficient security capabilities

Short Description (one paragraph)

## Description

  - weak built-in security features like basic Bluetooth
  - attention: this should not be a product placement
  - legacy-to-be
  - legacy products for new deployments
  - protocols missing confidenciality/integrity (depends upon trust-zone)
  - differentiation to 'missing awareness'
    - here: security feature is not available
    - 'missing awareness': feature is availabe, but not configured
