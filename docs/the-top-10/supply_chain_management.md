# Supplier/Supply Chain Management

Short Description (one paragraph)

## Description

  - treat it like partners management?
    - treat IT as supplier too?
    - make sure that IT people understand that this is not only dependency management

  - OT has a 'special' situation with integrators needing access
    - (is this so special, there's the same problem with managed SOCs, outsourced administration done by system houses)

  - organization issue
    - like SLAs, notifications
    - product specific issues woudl rather be "Devices out in the field with known Vulnerabilities/Issues"

## Rationale

- why did we include this item in the top 10?

## Known Attacks/Examples

- [NotPetya: It was believed that the software update mechanism of M.E.Doc—a Ukrainian tax preparation program that, according to F-Secure analyst Mikko Hyppönen, "appears to be de facto" among companies doing business in the country—had been compromised to spread the malware. Analysis by ESET found that a backdoor had been present in the update system for at least six weeks prior to the attack, describing it as a "thoroughly well-planned and well-executed operation". The developers of M.E.Doc denied that they were entirely responsible for the cyberattack, stating that they too were victims.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petya_(malware_family))
