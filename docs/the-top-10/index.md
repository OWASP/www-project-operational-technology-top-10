# The Top 10

## Methodology

### How were the OT Top 10 created?

- meetings every two weeks to gather the top 10 list
- quantitative discussion to form the top 10

### How did we make sure that we covered reality?

- check existing OT incident reports and see if the proposed top 10 fit

## Structure of each Top 10 Item (also see [template](./template.md))

Each entry in the OWASP OT Top 10 will be accompanied by a short description, public incidents exploiting that entry, recommended mitigation and countermeasures, as well as references and tooling to assist in addressing the identified risks.
