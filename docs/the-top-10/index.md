# The Top 10

## Methodology

### How were the OT Top 10 created?

- meetings every two weeks to gather the top 10 list
- quantitative discussion to form the top 10

### How did we make sure that we covered reality?

- check existing OT incident reports and see if the proposed top 10 fit

## Preliminary Top 10 List

## Structure of each Top 10 Item

Each entry in the OWASP OT Top 10 will be accompanied by a short description, public incidents exploiting that entry, recommended mitigation and countermeasures, as well as references and tooling to assist in addressing the identified risks.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Name/Title of the Item |
| Description | Show description of the item |
| Rationale | Why did we find this item important enough for inclusion? |
| Known OT Attacks utilizing this Item | <https://www.icsadvisoryproject.com>, <https://icsstrive.com/> |
| Mitigation/Countermeasures | There will be multiple levels: 1) design and implementation level mitigations for developers/builders;  2) operational mitigations for integrators, e.g., air-gapping systems |
| Next actionable steps | What can be done to identify and mitigate the issue? |
