Short Description (one paragraph)

## Description

  - trying to wiggle out of security features via deflection to obscurity
  - cyber-security hygiene
  - everything configuration related
    - missing encryption even if available
    - available JTAG/SWD interface left enabled on production devices
    - Intentional misconfiguration for ease of use, e.g., leaving rtuâ€™s in upload mode
    - lack of hardening
  - why are security best-practises not applied? missing knowledge?
  - culture
  - OT guys know something that the IT guys know not
