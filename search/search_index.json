OT plays an active role across all sectors including manufacturing, energy, transportation, medical, and utilities. In case of indirect interaction, these systems manage other systems or devices that themselves interact with the physical world in a direct way. All of these interactions happen through monitoring and controlling devices, processes, and events.</p> <p>A very simple example for that could be a thermostat that monitors the temperature in a room. If it senses, that it gets to cold, it turns up the heating thus changes the physical environment around it. Due to this interleaving with the physical world, the term cyber-physical system (CPS) is often used synonymously with OT. While the increased use of CPS is not least due to the increasing convergence of IT, OT and IoT, this mixture of fields can also sometimes make the term blurry.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/#types-of-ot-systems","title":"Types of OT Systems","text":"<p>Not only are the types of systems and devices diverse, but so are the environments which utilize OT systems. Virtually no modern industry or environment operates without a large set of OT systems in operation.</p> <p>Operational Technology (OT) systems encompass a wide range of devices and control systems used in various industries.</p> <p>On a low-level, these systems include small 8 to 32-bit microcontrollers embedded in purpose-built devices, which are designed for specific tasks and are often found in industrial and commercial applications. Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are another key component of OT systems, providing automation and control in manufacturing processes and other industrial environments.</p> <p>OT systems also include complex control systems that span multiple sites, such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. SCADA systems are used to monitor and control large-scale processes and infrastructure, including utilities and transportation networks. Building Automation Systems (BAS) are used to manage and control building operations, such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting, and security.</p> <p>Physical access control systems are employed to secure facilities and restrict access to authorized personnel.</p> <p>Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) are integral to the operation of manufacturing plants and other industrial facilities, ensuring efficient and safe production processes. Refrigeration control systems are used in various industries to maintain the proper temperature for storage and processing. Water purification control and safety systems are critical for ensuring the safety and quality of water supplies. In the oil and gas industry, OT systems are used to control and monitor pumping, flow, and processing operations.</p> <p>Medical devices also rely on OT systems for accurate and reliable operation, ensuring patient safety and effective treatment.</p> <p>Overall, OT systems are essential for the operation of many industries, and they far outnumber Information Technology (IT) systems in use. OT security problems in these industries can have major impacts on the society and surrounding environment. This is also why OT security is of ever-increasing importance, this can be seen in previous attacks using several highly sophisticated pieces of malware that have already affected OT systems, from the notorious Stuxnet in 2010 to power outages in Ukraine due to attack tools such as BlackEnergy or Industroyer.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/#example-ot-architectures","title":"Example OT Architectures","text":"<p>A typical OT system consists of control loops, human-machine interfaces (HMI) and remote diagnostics and maintenance tools like depicted in the image below.</p> <p> Source: NIST SP 800-82r3, p. 11</p> <p>A control loop is meant \u2013 as the name suggests \u2013 to control some kind of process. To do so, the loop employs a combination of sensors, actuators and controllers. Sensors measure certain physical properties like temperature or pressure and send these controlled variables to the controller. This component acts as the brain of the loop. By interpreting the sent information based on a control algorithm and target set points, so-called manipulated variables are created. These are sent to the actuators, which are the components that directly manipulate the controlled process according to the commands of the controller.</p> <p>For example, a sensor that measures the temperature of a boiler sends the controlled variable temperature to the controller. If the controller determines that the measured temperature is below the set target, he instructs an actuator to activate the heater rod of the boiler until the temperature matches the set target temperature again.</p> <p>This process can mostly be monitored and manipulated by human operators via the so-called HMI. In our example the HMI maybe allows the operators to change the target temperature and to observe the current state of the boiler. Finally, remote diagnostics and maintenance tools can be used in case of abnormal operation of the system or solution.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/#purdue-reference-model","title":"Purdue Reference Model","text":"<p>While this control loop gives a general overview of the principal function of a control system, not all OT systems and devices are equal. While some like PLCs are more involved in direct control of individual processes, others are used on a higher level to monitor and control whole ecosystems. An example for such a high level system would be a geographically distributed SCADA system used to monitor and control a complex infrastructure like a power grid.</p> <p>To get a better conceptual understanding of the different OT technologies, the Purdue Reference Model can be used. This hierarchical model depicts the data flows in ICS networks and is composed of several layers. While initially deployed in the 1990s, the Purdue Model today exists in many slightly modified versions, but in general there are 6 separate levels and additional DMZs between them. The image below shows these levels starting with Level 0 (the actual physical field devices) up to Level 5, where the enterprise IT resides. It can be seen that when going up the levels, the corresponding devices scope gets broader. While Level 0 and Level 1 are limited to the direct process (\u201cshopfloor\u201d), Level 2 already comprises a whole local station.</p> <p> Source: Limes Security ICS.211 Industrial Security Training Advanced Technical Expert, p. 345</p> <p>It has to be noted that the Purdue Model should not be seen as a strict, universal architecture, but a reference to think about how the overall system can be structured and where trust boundaries can and should occur. Nonetheless, the diagram above already shows one crucial security consideration in OT: The segmentation and separation between IT and OT (in this case realized by Level 3.5 IT/OT DMZ). As most security incidents still occur in IT, it is of utmost importance to prevent such an incident to spread to OT.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/#common-it-systems-in-ot","title":"Common IT-Systems in OT","text":"<p>Knowing now about the Purdue Model, the question arises about common IT devices such as PCs or printers and their relationship to the OT network and systems. Here we need to remind ourselves that the terms Information Technology and Operational Technology are just terms to describe a broader range of certain devices with a common purpose, not even common functionality. OT and IT are just concepts and have no strict universally applicable definition. Therefore, the question of whether \"IT\" devices belong in OT or are OT devices is a classic \"it depends\".</p> <p>The easiest categorization would be to view everything below Purdue 3.5 (DMZ) as OT regardless of the device. This makes sense when looking at three examples from different fields:</p> <ul> <li>An HMI for a CNC machine: The HMI is basically a more or less normal Windows PC that controls the CNC machine directly. The Windows PC is therefore an integral part of the OT infrastructure. The same applies to other devices such as CT scanning or MRI machines in the medical field.</li> <li>SCADA is a term strongly rooted in the OT world. But SCADA is nowadays just Windows PCs with custom software and remote interfaces. No one would argue that a SCADA system is not part of core OT systems. But underneath the visualization, it is \"just common IT devices\".</li> <li>ERP functions are offloaded into a cloud environment. There exists a site-to-site tunnel that integrates the cloud environment into Purdue Level 3. In this case, that network in the cloud is also part OT and has to be considered when calculating risk for example.</li> </ul> <p>With those examples and the reasoning above, we can define OT-devices are devices that are part of the OT domain (general domain, not AD) and IT devices are part of the IT domain.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/#stakeholders","title":"Stakeholders","text":"<p>To achieve security in OT systems and devices, several stakeholders have to work hand in hand. For example, the standards series for security for OT in automation and control systems IEC 62443 lists the following crucial roles:</p> <ul> <li>The asset owner that operates the so-called Industrial Automation and Control System (IACS). IACS is a generic term of IEC 62443 that describes a control system and any complementary hardware and software components that have been installed and configured to operate together.</li> <li>The maintenance service provider that \u2013 as the name implies \u2013 maintains an IACS.</li> <li>The integration service provider (integrator) that assembles a whole automation solution for a intended environment by combining several components.</li> <li>The product supplier that develops and manufactures components like applications, embedded devices, network components or similar.</li> </ul> <p>OT security challenges are different for these stakeholders, which is also reflected in the different standards of the IEC 62443 series. For example, an operator does not have access to the development process of the specific component and thus cannot implement security measures at the source code level.</p> <p>On the other hand, the operator more or less can shape the intended environment where the solution is employed and therefor is capable of introducing mitigating measures like strong network segmentation.</p> <p>As the impact of security failures in OT can be tremendous, there is an increasing number of laws and regulations governing the development and operation of OT systems and devices. Examples are the European NIS2 and the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), the US EO14028 or the China Cybersecurity Law.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/itsec_for_ot_people/","title":"Security for OT: Why Is It Problematic?","text":"<p>While the term \u201coperational technology\u201d (OT) is fairly new, originating in the early 2000s, the underlying technology is not. Ranging back to mechanical control systems, industrial control systems (ICS) for example have come a long way. PLCs were already introduced in the 1960s, predating the first personal computer (the Apple 1 in 1976) by over a decade. Also, the integration with SCADA, starting in the 1980s, took place at the same time as the Internet was just beginning to become established more broadly.  This long-standing history created a very specific culture amongst the engineers and operators designing and using such systems, coming with its own tenets, views and best practices.</p> <p>Naturally, at the onset of OT, malicious attackers were not a problem to be thought of \u2013 at that time they weren\u2019t even for IT. But even when cyber-attacks finally materialized increasingly, they spared OT by large. The technology was difficult to understand and even more difficult to get access to, systems did not feature the kind of connectivity they do today and the attack surface to explore and exploit was far bigger and more rewarding on the IT side of things. It should come to no surprise therefore that in comparison to safety \u2013 which was and is paramount in OT \u2013 security was never a large concern historically. With operators coming mainly from an engineering background, they also did not pick up the cultural security changes that have manifested in the IT community over the last decades.</p> <p>For quite a long time this did not prove to be problematic, attacks almost exclusively targeted IT systems. But then, in 2010, the discovery of Stuxnet sent shock waves through the security community, putting ICS and soon OT in general in an ever-increasing focus. Over half a century after the introduction of the first PLCs, the rate of occurrence of ICS-related attacks and malware started to rise steeply throughout the 2010s with the time between attacks ever decreasing since. Industroyer (2016), TRITON (2017), and Industroyer2 (2022) are just some of the most infamous attacks, showcasing how security incidents can degrade safety and availability \u2013 the traditional top concerns in OT.</p> <p>While cultural security issues mentioned above still persist (but are decreasing), OT often suffers from additional structural and organizational problems when trying to tackle the growing threat from malicious actors. Many organizations simply cannot easily update or substitute vulnerable systems like it is mostly possible in IT. The adage \u201cnever change a running system\u201d becomes even more true, if the system is a power plant for example, making major contributions to the national power grid and the regional power supply. It is simply not possible to shut down the whole plant on short notice to install an emergency patch for a newly detected vulnerability. Additionally, in comparison to IT, systems have a very long lifetime, exposing them to outdated software and subsequent known vulnerabilities even more.</p> <p>All these factors and more \u2013 growing threat landscape, increasing connectivity in OT for more efficient management and operation, insufficient security \u2013 have lead governments and regulatory bodies around the world to introduce legislation effectively forcing the OT community to evolve their security culture and posture like IT has done over the last two decades.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/itsec_for_ot_people/#common-problems-and-false-assumptions-about-ot-security","title":"Common Problems and False Assumptions About OT Security","text":"<p>Changing cultures and even more so carefully engineered complex and critical systems like power plants, production sites and traffic control systems has the potential to cause friction and problems. This is totally understandable, as even in IT the introduction of new security technology and measures can create major pain points in the beginning. Nonetheless, neglecting security for a short-time saving of money and effort is a perfect setup for even more complications in the future when legislation tightens or if an actual attack happens, probably affecting availability and at worst even safety. Think about it that way: When security measures are planned and introduced, you dictate the circumstances, the execution time and potential downtimes.  But when you have to respond to a security-related incident the circumstances dictate everything. You then have very limited say in downtimes, required resources and above all the time when it has to happen.</p> <p>To help with some common concerns and possible frictions, the following paragraph should address the most common complaints to alleviate the introduction of security in OT environments:</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/itsec_for_ot_people/#security-vs-safety","title":"Security vs. Safety","text":"<p>We do not need security, we have more than enough safety mechanisms in place</p> <p>As acknowledged before, safety is paramount \u2013 and with good reason! An exploding turbine affecting the lives of operators around it is undeniably more serious than a file server in an office getting encrypted by ransomware. Looking at safety in OT reveals how diligently the OT culture treats risk to life. Most of the time, there are multiple layers of safety mechanisms ensuring that even in face of failure of one layer, another one intervenes.</p> <p>On a side note, this concept, commonly referred to as \u201cdefense in depth\u201d, is also highly relevant to OT security. But even in face of these intricate safety mechanisms, think about cases where safety systems are explicitly targeted by malicious actors to prevent them from kicking in. Recall the aforementioned TRITON malware that explicitly targeted the safety systems of a petrochemical plant. In other words, security is an active enabler of safety. If security is compromised, this can pose a direct threat to safety systems and mechanisms. Therefore, safety and security cannot be seen as redundant but are two sides of the same coin trying to achieve the same goal \u2013 keeping the systems running in a safe state.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/itsec_for_ot_people/#security-vs-availability","title":"Security vs. Availability","text":"<p>We cannot harden/update systems to make them secure as we cannot afford the downtime</p> <p>System availability is only second to safety in most cases, so naturally many systems cannot simply be taken down to introduce updates or change configurations. This is often hard to grasp for security professionals coming from an IT background. Every downtime has to be meticulously planned in advance. But this does not mean that downtimes are impossible in general. They do happen! Every component needs maintenance at some point in time and OT staff is usually highly experienced to align such maintenance downtimes with business goals and possibly existing regulatory requirements.</p> <p>These time frames should therefore also be used to introduce security-relevant topics. To do so, a security roadmap detailing what measure can be implemented at what maintenance downtime has to be carefully crafted. As said before, this is your advantage when you tackle security in a pro-active way \u2013 you decide on when something happens! Of special concern is of course patch management, as on the one hand patches are usually released more often than there are maintenance downtimes and on the other hand older systems often do not receive them at all. With the former again careful planning goes a long way. By establishing a process rating the severity of a patch, updates and their urgency can be aligned with maintenance tasks.</p> <p>So, unlike in IT, more uncritical patches can be postponed to a later point in time, while for critical emergency patches plans can be made in advance (often together with suppliers) on how to implement them. For the latter problem, the already mentioned \u201cdefense in depth\u201d approach comes into play. Only because there are no direct patches for systems, it does not mean that there are no other security measures reducing the risk of a successful attack like, for example, careful network segmentation. By such \u201cindirect measures\u201d even systems that cannot be patched (yet) can be protected to an adequate level. This also helps in patch management in general, as patches can be postponed to a maintenance downtime easier when there are already other mitigations in place.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/itsec_for_ot_people/#trusting-the-blast-zones","title":"Trusting the Blast Zones","text":"<p>Our systems are isolated so there is no way to access them anyway.

If the stick is infected with malware, your OT environment can be compromised soon \u2013 without any connection to the outside! This is a good case for \u201cdefense in depth\u201d again: Physical access control and network segmentation are both important factors in a comprehensive security strategy.

Especially OT protocols often cater to very specific performance requirements like real-time communication. As most of these protocols are quite old, security was not taken into account during creation. While there are some newer protocols with security features (like OPC UA) and some older ones offer security extensions (like PROFINET), these are often not supported by vendors or are not applicable to certain tasks. This should not discourage anybody from looking for alternative security measures.</p> <p>If the protocol layer cannot be secured, then other mitigations like careful network segmentation or monitoring can significantly improve security posture. Especially as the OT security market is ever growing, more and more vendors are coming up with specific OT security products taking into account the complex requirements of many OT environments.  During the years-long experience of the authors of this document, there was never the case that there were no possible security improvements for the environment.

OT staff has in general a completely different background and view on security/safety than IT staff. While this at first seems to be a hindrance, it does not have to be that way. In-depth OT-specific knowledge is crucial in securing OT environments as well as in detecting and responding to security incidents. Typically, the engineers working with the systems are the first to notice strange behavior, being the primary source of (human) detection of attacks. They also know the specific characteristics, the requirements and the processes coming with their systems. Without this knowledge it is nigh impossible to craft a tailored security strategy like described above. The lack of security know-how can be tackled in several ways and depends on the organization of the company/organization: If there already is security personnel and no specific OT security team is planned, a closer collaboration between IT and OT staff can lead to greater understanding on both sides.</p> <p>Experience has shown that IT security staff can come up with viable solutions for OT security problems once they have grasped the difference between IT and OT. For this you may refer them to the chapter \u201cOT for IT Sec People\u201d. OT staff on the other hand do not have to become in-depth security experts in this case. Enabling them to think like an attacker and see potential vulnerabilities beforehand can go a long way. OT personnel already work with (safety) risks every day, so the required mental effort to also deal with risks that are introduced on purpose is often not that high.</p> <p>There is also a steady increase in educational material for OT security, be it in the form of free documents on the Internet or in the form of instructor-led training programs. Such training programs can also be of value in the case of bigger organizations that decide to establish specific OT security teams. This of course leads to subject matter experts that combine the best of both worlds, but it takes a lot of time and money to train such a team. Whatever fits your organization, it must be explicitly noted that giving additional security tasks to an already overworked staff is a recipe for disaster.
