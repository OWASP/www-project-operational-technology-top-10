These systems are integral to the functionality of critical infrastructure, and any disruption or compromise can have severe consequences, ranging from operational downtime and financial losses to potential safety hazards and national security risks.

In case of indirect interaction, these systems manage other systems or devices that themselves interact with the physical world in a direct way. All of these interactions happen through monitoring and controlling devices, processes, and events.</p> <p>A very simple example for that could be a thermostat that monitors the temperature in a room. If it senses, that it gets to cold, it turns up the heating thus changes the physical environment around it. Due to this interleaving with the physical world, the term cyber-physical system (CPS) is often used synonymously with OT. While the increased use of CPS is not least due to the increasing convergence of IT, OT and IoT, this mixture of fields can also sometimes make the term blurry.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/#types-of-ot-systems","title":"Types of OT Systems","text":"<p>OT systems can come in a wide variety of forms, ranging from small programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to (multiple) site encompassing control systems like supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) or distributed control systems (DCS). Also, building automation systems or short BAS are considered to be OT (like in the thermostat example before). So are physical access control systems and even medical IoT devices are part of OT. But not only the types of systems and devices are diverse, so are the industries and infrastructures fielding OT systems. From chemical production to the transportation sector \u2013 almost no modern infrastructure operates without OT components.</p> <p>Especially due to the usage in critical infrastructure like in energy or water and wastewater infrastructure, OT security problems can have major impacts on the society relying on these infrastructures. This is also why OT security is of ever increasing importance, not least as several highly sophisticated pieces of malware have already affected OT system, from the notorious Stuxnet in 2010 to several power outages in Ukraine since 2015 due to software like BlackEnergy or Industroyer.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/#stakeholders","title":"Stakeholders","text":"<p>To achieve security in OT systems and devices, several stakeholders have to work hand in hand. For example, the standards series for security for OT in automation and control systems IEC 62443 lists the following crucial roles:</p> <ul> <li>The asset owner that operates the so-called Industrial Automation and Control System (IACS). IACS is a generic term of IEC 62443 that describes a control system and any complementary hardware and software components that have been installed and configured to operate together.</li> <li>The maintenance service provider that \u2013 as the name implies \u2013 maintains an IACS.</li> <li>The integration service provider (integrator) that assembles a whole automation solution for a intended environment by combining several components.</li> <li>The product supplier that develops and manufactures components like applications, embedded devices, network components or similar.</li> </ul> <p>OT security challenges are different for these stakeholders, which is also reflected in the different standards of the IEC 62443 series. For example, an operator does not have access to the development process of the specific component and thus cannot implement security measures at the source code level. On the other hand, the operator more or less can shape the intended environment where the solution is employed and therefor is capable of introducing mitigating measures like strong network segmentation.</p> <p>As the impact of security failures in OT can be tremendous, there is an increasing number of laws and regulations governing the development and operation of OT systems and devices. Examples are the European NIS2 and the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), the US EO14028 or the China Cybersecurity Law.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/culture/","title":"Security Culture","text":""},{"location":"background-ot/culture/#description","title":"Description","text":"<ul> <li>security not a big priority of engineers?</li> <li>security by obscurity?</li> <li>no common software frameworks in use?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"background-ot/ot-architectures/","title":"Example Architectures","text":"<p>A typical OT system consists of control loops, human-machine interfaces (HMI) and remote diagnostics and maintenance tools like depicted in the image below.</p> <p> Source: NIST SP 800-82r3, p. 11</p> <p>A control loop is meant \u2013 as the name suggests \u2013 to control some kind of process. To do so, the loop employs a combination of sensors, actuators and controllers. Sensors measure certain physical properties like temperature or pressure and send these controlled variables to the controller. This component acts as the brain of the loop. By interpreting the sent information based on a control algorithm and target set points, so-called manipulated variables are created. These are sent to the actuators, which are the components that directly manipulate the controlled process according to the commands of the controller. For example, a sensor that measures the temperature of a boiler sends the controlled variable temperature to the controller. If the controller determines that the measured temperature is below the set target, he instructs an actuator to activate the heater rod of the boiler until the temperature matches the set target temperature again.</p> <p>This process can mostly be monitored and manipulated by human operators via the so-called HMI. In our example the HMI maybe allows the operators to change the target temperature and to observe the current state of the boiler. Finally, remote diagnostics and maintenance tools can be used in case of abnormal operation of the system or solution.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/ot-architectures/#purdue-model","title":"Purdue Model","text":"<p>While this control loop gives a general overview of the principal function of a control system, not all OT systems and devices are equal. While some like PLCs are more involved in direct control of individual processes, others are used on a higher level to monitor and control whole ecosystems. An example for such a high level system would be a geographically distributed SCADA system used to monitor and control a complex infrastructure like a power grid. To get a better conceptual understanding of the different OT technologies, the Purdue Reference Model can be used. This hierarchical model depicts the data flows in ICS networks and is composed of several layers. While initially deployed in the 1990s, the Purdue Model today exists in many slightly modified versions, but in general there are 6 separate levels and additional DMZs between them. The image below shows these levels starting with Level 0 (the actual physical field devices) up to Level 5, where the enterprise IT resides. It can be seen that when going up the levels, the corresponding devices scope gets broader. While Level 0 and Level 1 are limited to the direct process (\u201cshopfloor\u201d), Level 2 already comprises a whole local station.</p> <p> Source: Limes Security ICS.211 Industrial Security Training Advanced Technical Expert, p. 345</p> <p>It has to be noted that the Purdue Model should not be seen as a strict, universal architecture, but a reference to think about how the overall system can be structured and where trust boundaries can and should occur. Nonetheless, the diagram above already shows one crucial security consideration in OT: The segmentation and separation between IT and OT (in this case realized by Level 3.5 IT/OT DMZ). As most security incidents still occur in IT, it is of utmost importance to prevent such an incident to spread to OT.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/ot-vs-it/","title":"OT vs IT \u2013 Differences in Security and Culture","text":"<p>Although there is an increasing convergence of IT and OT and regular IT systems are just as well used in OT environments, there are nonetheless fundamental differences in security goals and security culture.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/ot-vs-it/#safety-vs-security","title":"Safety vs. Security","text":"<p>Traditionally, security can be defined by the mixture of the three security goals confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This is also known as the CIA triad.</p> <p>While in IT commonly confidentiality and integrity are paramount, confidentiality is mostly of lesser importance in OT as it is often employed in more or less physically restricted environments. The most important goal in OT is safety, as humans can get harmed or even worse get killed when OT systems and devices malfunction.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/ot-vs-it/#availability-is-paramount","title":"Availability is Paramount","text":"<p>Besides that, availability is paramount. Be it production site, be it critical energy infrastructure \u2013 many OT environments cannot afford even the smallest downtime. This also is reflected in security testing of OT, where many tools that are commonly deployed in IT environments can carry a significant risk if not used carefully in OT.</p> <p>For example, a simple port and service scan with the well-known tool nmap is a common approach to start off the enumeration in a penetration test. While this is totally fine in most IT systems, there are many PLCs that can crash if they receive such packets. This is mainly due to their highly specific intended usage in certain processes and the resource constraints that come with them. Additionally, due to special requirements like real-time capabilities many proprietary protocols are used to complement standard protocols. This makes the testing process harder in general as there is less crossover between different environments.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/ot-vs-it/#worst-case-scenarios","title":"Worst-Case Scenarios","text":"<p>The focus on safety and availability is also reflected in OT worst-case scenarios. While in IT loss of data confidentiality or manipulation of data is often catastrophic, OT worst-cases are loss of view (LOV) and loss of control (LOC). LOV describes a scenario where the operators do not have visibility or correct visibility of what is happening with the process. So the systems still operate, but it is unknown what they are currently doing and if they are actually doing the right thing.</p> <p>An example for LOV was when Stuxnet manipulated monitoring of Iranian operators to mislead them thinking that everything was working correctly. LOC, as the name implies, means that the operators cannot control the process and its systems anymore more, making them unable to respond to possible unsafe operations.</p>"},{"location":"background-ot/ot-vs-it/#system-lifetimes","title":"System Lifetimes","text":"<p>While security culture is shifting in OT and is undeniably growing in importance due to an increasing number of regulations and cyberattacks, this culture shift unfortunately is quite slow.</p> <p>Unlike IT systems with their short lifetime, OT systems are used for 15 to 20 years.</p> <p>As patching is often not possible due to the resource reasons and possible outages mentioned before, there are many vulnerable legacy systems and insecure protocols in active use for years to come.
